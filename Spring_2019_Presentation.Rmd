## Goals of the study

--

- interested in what acoustic parameters researchers measure and confirm as correlating with word stress

--

- what methodological basis are these results grounded on

--

- distill a clearer picture of the realtive robustness of different acoustic eponents of word stress

--

- do not attempt to address the complex issue of situating word stress within the broader taxonomy of prosodic systems

--

- assume word stress to be the phonological marking of one or more prominent syllables within the phonological word

---

# Methodologies 

- Several sources: surveys of 110 (sub-) studies of 75 languages (and varieties)

--

- included phonetics and areal studies journals,working papers volumes, books and dissertations 

--

- Encourage authors to submit corrections and invite scholars with published work on word stress

--

- database was intended to be as comprehensive as possible 

- Many studies were excluded: 

    1. Papers in which methodological description was too sparse to allow for replication

    2. studies that did not present quantitative results 

    3. studies/papers that were not explicitly focused on stress

- Papers on stress were included

---

# Results

- a large number of parameters potentially signal stress 
(duration, various F0 features, overall intensity, assorted frequency-weighted measures of intensity, vowel formant frequeencies)

--

- studies varied considerably 

---

# Availability 

- Yes!

## Rating 

- I would give this a 7.


Pros

- I didn't have to really change much except the working directory and make sure that I had tidyverse.





---
- able to download files as a zip file 

- Updated corpus was provided 

- able to compare article results with my results when I ran the code

- Can be updated if authors with similar work would like to send their data/information

Cons

- Figures were not from the present article, but from the other article as well. 

- Only produced 3 of the 4 figures
