# Acoustic correlates of word stress: a cross-linguistic survey
### Matthew Gordon &amp; Timo Roettger

---


## Goals of the study

--

- interested in what acoustic parameters researchers measure and confirm as correlating with word stress

--

- interested as to what methodological basis these results are grounded on

--

- distill a clearer picture of the relative robustness of different acoustic eponents of word stress

--

- does not attempt to address the complex issue of situating word stress within the broader taxonomy of prosodic systems

--

- assume word stress to be the phonological marking of one or more prominent syllables within the phonological word

--

- propose a set of recommendations for future research

---

# Methodologies 

- Several sources: surveys of 110 (sub-) studies of 75 languages (and varieties); adult speakers

--

- included phonetics and areal studies journals,working papers volumes, books and dissertations 

--

- Encourage authors to submit corrections and invite scholars with published work on word stress

--

- database was intended to be as comprehensive as possible (papers on stress) but many studies were excluded: 

    1. Papers in which methodological description was too sparse to allow for replication

    2. studies that did not present quantitative results 
    3. studies/papers that were not explicitly focused on stress

- Information such as name of language, whether language was tonal or not, examined word stress levels, acoustic parameters used to express word stress, etc. 

---

# Results

- a large number of parameters potentially signal stress 
- duration, various F0 features, overall intensity, assorted frequency-weighted measures of intensity, vowel formant frequencies

--

- studies varied considerably in which subset of these potential stress correlates are examined, making it difficult to establish which ones are most consistently cues to stress 

- Statistically, duration was the most reliable exponent of stress across all the languages 

- Study offers a first cross-linguistic assessment of the relative robustness of different potential acoustic exponents of word stress.

- The most recent version of the corpus as a .csv

- An rmd file that generated the plots from the most recent data table 

- html file

## Rating 

--

- I would give this a 9.


Pros

- Instructions on how to start and what is needed

- changed working directory 

- had tidyverse

# Continued...

- able to download files as a zip file 

- Updated corpus was provided 

- able to compare article results with my results when I ran the code

- Can be updated if authors with similar work would like to send their data/information

Cons

- Figures were not from only one article, but from the other article as well. 

- No readme file

- Only produced 3 of the 4 figures 

- comments kept getting vague (I didn't understand them)

- Used excel
